    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Shiro (Ge'ez: ሽሮ, romanized: šəro), also called shiro wat (Amharic: ሽሮ ወጥ, romanized: šəro wäṭ), or tsebhi shiro (Tigrinya: ጸብሒ ሽሮ, romanized: ṣäbhi šəro), is a stew served for either lunch or dinner, originating from Ethiopia and Eritrea.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>powdered chickpeas or broad bean meal</li>
        <li>minced onions</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>ground ginger(optional)</li>
        <li>chopped tomatoes(optional)</li>
        <li>chili-peppers(optional)</li>  
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Heat a medium sized pot (or Dutch oven) on medium heat. Then, add olive oil and heat it up for a minute. Add a diced onion, and sauté over low to medium heat for a few minutes until fragrant. The smaller you can dice your onions the better. Or, you can also puree the onions and add that instead! Then, add minced garlic along with tomato paste and sauté for a minute until garlic is fragrant.  </li>
        <li> Then, add the shiro powder, salt, and three cups of water. Bring this to a boil on medium heat, then turn the heat down and let the mixture simmer for 20 or 30 minutes (depends on the strength of the stove and the consistency you prefer!) Make sure to stir at five minute increments, so it doesn't stick. </li>
        <li> Serve hot with rice or injera (and stay tuned for my traditional and/or quick injera recipes!) </li>
    </ol>
